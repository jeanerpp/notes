* ssh x11 forwarding
  Enable X11 over IPv4 from another host, configuration in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
  X11Forwarding yes
  X11UseLocalhost no
  AddressFamily inet

  Because I change my HOME directory, I need to:
  export XAUTHORITY=/home/xujian/.Xauthority

  https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/110558/su-with-error-x11-connection-rejected-because-of-wrong-authentication/118295
  record a way to enable x11 after su to root:
  To fix things, firstly detect which display number standarduser uses:

  standarduser@localhost:~$ echo $DISPLAY
  localhost:21.0

  In this case it is 21.0. Secondly, display standarduser's list of cookies:
  standarduser@localhost:~$ xauth list
  localhost/unix:1  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  51a3801fd7776704575752f09015c61d
  localhost/unix:21  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  0ba2913f8d9df0ee9eda295cad7b104f
  localhost/unix:22  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  22ba6595c270f20f6315c53e27958dfe
  localhost/unix:20  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  267f68b51726a8a381cfc10c91783a13
  The cookie for the 21.0 display is the second in the list and ends with 104f.
  
  The last thing to do is to add this particular cookie to the root's .Xauthority. Log in as root and do the following:
  root@localhost:~$ xauth add localhost/unix:21  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  0ba2913f8d9df0ee9eda295cad7b104
  This is a plain and simple how to deal with the X11 connection rejected because of wrong authentication error while you run su as different users in bash script or screen. And, by the way, thanks to this guy for his brilliant post.
  
  And an easier solution:
  
  1.- ssh user@host
  
  2.- $ sudo su
  
  3.- # xauth merge /home/user/.Xauthority
* ssh debug
  client: run with -v and -p 12345 option
  server: configure sshd in debug detail mode, or start another one with "/sbin/sshd -dd -D -p 12345"
